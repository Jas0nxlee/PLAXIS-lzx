**1. Introduction**

    **1.1. Project Overview**
    This document outlines the requirements for a software application designed to automate the process of spudcan penetration analysis using PLAXIS 3D. The current workflow, detailed in "基于PLAXIS3D的海洋桩靴入泥深度设计流程.pdf," involves manual interaction with the PLAXIS 3D software. This project aims to streamline this process by developing a Python-based backend that interfaces with the PLAXIS command line and/or Python API, controlled by a user-friendly front-end graphical user interface (GUI). The application will guide users through input parameter definition, execute the PLAXIS analysis, and present the results in an accessible format.

    **1.2. Purpose of the Document**
